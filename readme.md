## Game Maker 8.2?

We highly recommend using GM 8.2 for developing games with this engine.
You can find it and related resources in the [gm82 server](http://discord.gg/P2hdajXnQk).

However, it's still possible to use it with regular Game Maker 8.1 as well:

First, place the included winspool.drv next to your Game Maker executable. This
will change the functionality of the "software vertex processing" checkbox in
Global Game Settings to instead reverse the order of creation events.

And second, the engine depends on four extensions:

- Game Maker 8.2 Core
- Game Maker 8.2 Networking
- Game Maker 8.2 Joystick
- Game Maker 8.2 Sound

Simply install them from the included folder.
