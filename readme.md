## Game Maker 8.2?

We highly recommend using GM 8.2 for developing games with this engine.
You can find it and related resources in the [gm82 server](https://discord.gg/b4QxacKumN).

However, it's still possible to use it with regular Game Maker 8.1 as well.
Instructions for doing that are provided with the release zip.
